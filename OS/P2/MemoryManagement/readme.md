**Memory Management Project**

The purpose of this project is to write a simulation that explores the effects of limited memory and memory management policies. 
The simulator will read policy information
and the characteristics of the workload from input files and then will simulate the execution
of the processes as well as decisions of Memory Manager (MM). The simulator will generate
an output file with the trace of important events, as well as the memory map and the input
queue status after each event. At the end of the simulation, the program will also print the
average turnaround time per process.
